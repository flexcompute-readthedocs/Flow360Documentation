Option@ Type@ Default@ Example@ Description
<edgeName>-> type@ [\"aniso\", \"projectAnisoSpacing\"]@ REQUIRED@ \"aniso\"@ type=\"aniso\": anisotropic surface cells growing along the orthogonal direction to the edge named <edgeName>. See :numref:`fig1_surfMesh_edges`. type=\"projectAnisoSpacing\": project spacing, see: :numref:`fig_surfMesh_edges_projectAnisoSpacing`.
<edgeName>-> method@ [\"angle\", \"height\", \"aspectRatio\"]@ REQUIRED@ \"height\"@ For type=\"aniso\": how anisotropic surface cells grow. \"angle\": first layer thickness resolves surface curvature angle provided by \"value\"; \"height\": provide absolute value for first layer thickness; \"aspectRatio\": provide aspect ratio of the first surface cell grown from the edge.
<edgeName>-> value@ float@ REQUIRED@ 1e-3@ For type=\"aniso\": value used in \"method\" of growing surface cells from the edge.
<edgeName>-> adapt@ boolean@ FALSE@ @ Turn on/off the extra refinement based on surface proximity.
