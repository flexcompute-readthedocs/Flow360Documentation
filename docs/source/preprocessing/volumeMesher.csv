Option@ Type@ Default@ Example@ Description
refinementFactor@ float@ 1@ 2@ If refinementFactor=r is provided all spacings will be adjusted to generate r-times finer mesh everywhere. For example, if refinementFactor=2, all spacings will be divided by :math:`2^{1/3}\approx 1.26` , so the resulting mesh will have approximately 2 times more nodes.
volume@ dict@ REQUIRED@ @ First layer thickness and growth rate for prism layers being grown out of the surface. It is applied to all surface mesh faces.
volume-> firstLayerThickness@ float@ REQUIRED@ 1e-5@ First layer thickness for volume prism layers.
volume-> TRexGrowthRate@ float@ REQUIRED@ 1.2@ Growth rate for volume prism layers.
sources@ list(dict)@ []@ @ Description of refinement zones. For details see :ref:`here<JSON volume mesher sources>`.
actuatorDisks@ list(dict)@ []@ @ Description of actuator disks. This generates a cylindrical shape (hollowed or not) with structured mesh in it. Used for actuator disks. For details see :ref:`here<JSON volume mesher actuatorDisks>`.
