Options@ Default@ Description
outputFormat@ paraview@ \"paraview\" or \"tecplot\" or \"both\"
animationFrequency@ -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which volume output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyOffset@ 0@ Offset (in number of physical time steps) at which volume output animation is started. 0 is at beginning of simulation
animationFrequencyTimeAverage@ -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which time averaged volume output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyTimeAverageOffset@ 0@ Offset (in number of physical time steps) at which time averaged volume output animation is started. 0 is at beginning of simulation
startAverageIntegrationStep@ 0@ Physical time step to start averaging forces/moments, only if computeTimeAverages is True. Fields that can be averaged: primitiveVars, vorticity, T, s, Cp, mut, Mach, qcriterion
computeTimeAverages@ FALSE@ Whether or not to compute time-averaged quantities (**time averaging is not supported for cases with rotating domains for now**)
primitiveVars@ TRUE@ Outputs rho, u, v, w, p
vorticity@ FALSE@ Vorticity
residualNavierStokes@ FALSE@ 5 components of the N-S residual
residualTurbulence@ FALSE@ Residual for the turbulence model
residualTransition@ FALSE@ Residual for the transition model
solutionTurbulence@ FALSE@ Solution for the turbulence model
solutionTransition@ FALSE@ Solution for the transition model
T@ FALSE@ Temperature
s@ FALSE@ Entropy
Cp@ TRUE@ Coefficient of pressure. :math:`C_p=(\frac{p-p_\infty}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty{U_{ref}}^2})`.
mut@ TRUE@ Turbulent viscosity
nuHat@ TRUE@ nuHat
kOmega@ FALSE@ k and omega when using kOmegaSST model
mutRatio@ FALSE@ :math:`\mu_t/{\mu_\infty}`
Mach@ TRUE@ Mach number
VelocityRelative@ FALSE@ velocity in rotating frame
qcriterion@ FALSE@ Q criterion
gradW@ FALSE@ Gradient of W
wallDistance@ FALSE@ wall distance
wallDistanceDir@ FALSE@ wall distance direction
betMetrics@ FALSE@ 8 quantities related to BET solvers: velocityX, velocityY and velocityZ in rotating reference frame, alpha angle, Cf in axial direction, Cf in circumferential direction, tip loss factor, local solidity multiplied by integration weight
