Options@ Default@ Description
physicalSteps@ 1@ Number of physical steps. \"maxPhysicalSteps\" is a supported alias for this entry
timeStepSize@ \"inf\"@ Nondimensional time step size in physical step marching, it is calculated as :math:`\frac{\Delta t_{physical} C_\infty}{L_{gridUnit}}`, where the :math:`\Delta t_{physical}` is the physical time (in seconds) step size. "inf" means steady solver.
maxPseudoSteps@ 2000@ Maximum pseudo steps within one physical step 
CFL->initial@ 5@ Initial CFL for solving pseudo time step 
CFL->final@ 200@ Final CFL for solving pseudo time step 
CFL->rampSteps@ 40@ Number of steps before reaching the final CFL within 1 physical step
