Options@ Default@ Description
Reynolds@ Not required if muRef exists@ For example, for a mesh with phyiscal length 1.5m represented by 1500 grid units (i.e. mesh is in mm), the :math:`L_{gridUnit}` in the numerator is 0.001m.
muRef@ Not required if Reynolds exists@ The refererence dynamic viscosity (non-dimenstional) in our solver, = :math:`\frac{\mu_\infty}{\rho_\infty C_\infty L_{gridUnit}}`
Mach@ REQUIRED@ The Mach number, the ratio of freestream speed to the speed of sound.
MachRef@ Required if Mach == 0@ The reference Mach number to compute nondimensional quantities, e.g. CL, CD, CFx, CFy, CFz, CMz, CMy, CMz, etc..., = :math:`U_{ref}/C_\infty`. Its default value is "freestream"->"Mach".
Temperature@ REQUIRED@ The reference temperature in Kelvin. -1 means globally constant viscosity.
alphaAngle@ REQUIRED@ The angle of attack in degrees.
betaAngle@ REQUIRED@ The side slip angle in degrees.
turbulentViscosityRatio@ DEPENDS@ The ratio between the freestream turbulent viscosity and freestream laminar viscosity. This value is used by the turbulence models to determine the reference values for solution variables for freestream boundary conditions and also to set the initial condition. For SpalartAllmaras turbulence model, the default value is :math:`0.210438` if transition is not used and :math:`2.794\times10^{-7}` if transition model is used. For kOmegaSST, the default value is 0.01.
