Options@ Default@ Description
outputFormat@ paraview@ \"paraview\" or \"tecplot\"
animationFrequency@ -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which volume output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyOffset@ 0@ Offset of phyiscal time step upon animationFrequency at which volume output is saved. e.g. if animationFrequency = 10 and animationFrequencyOffset = 6, the volumetric visualization files will be saved at physical time step = 16, 26, 36, 46...
animationFrequencyTimeAverage@ -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which time-averaged volume output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyTimeAverageOffset@ 0@ Offset of phyiscal time step upon animationFrequencyTimeAverage at which time-averaged volume output is saved. e.g. if animationFrequencyTimeAverage = 10 and animationFrequencyTimeAverageOffset = 6, the time-averaged volumetric visualization files will be saved at physical time step = 16, 26, 36, 46...
