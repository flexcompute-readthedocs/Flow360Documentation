Options@  Default@ Description
outputFormat@ paraview@ \"paraview\" or \"tecplot\"
animationFrequency@    -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which surface output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyOffset@    0@ Offset of phyiscal time step upon animationFrequency at which surface output is saved. e.g. if animationFrequency = 10 and animationFrequencyOffset = 6, the surface visualization files will be saved at physical time step = 16, 26, 36, 46...
animationFrequencyTimeAverage@    -1@ Frequency (in number of physical time steps) at which time-averaged surface output is saved. -1 is at end of simulation
animationFrequencyTimeAverageOffset@    0@ Offset of phyiscal time step upon animationFrequencyTimeAverage at which time-averaged surface output is saved. e.g. if animationFrequencyTimeAverage = 10 and animationFrequencyTimeAverageOffset = 6, the time-averaged surface visualization files will be saved at physical time step = 16, 26, 36, 46...
primitiveVars@   FALSE@ rho, u, v, w, p
Cp@   FALSE@ Coefficient of pressure
Cf@   FALSE@ Skin friction coefficient
heatFlux@   FALSE@ Heat Flux
CfVec@   FALSE@ Viscous stress coefficient vector. For example, :math:`C_{f_{Vec}}[3]=\frac{\tau_{wall}[3]}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty U_{ref}^2}`. The :math:`\tau_{wall}` is the vector of viscous stress on the wall.
yPlus@   FALSE@ y+
wallDistance@   FALSE@ Wall Distance
Mach@   FALSE@ Mach number
nodeForcesPerUnitArea@   FALSE@ :math:`nodeForcesPerUnitArea=\frac{\tau_{wall}[3]-(p-p_\infty)*normal[3]}{\rho_\infty C_\infty^2}`, where the :math:`normal[3]` is the unit normal vector pointing from solid to fluid.
residualSA@   FALSE@ Spalart-Allmaras residual magnitude
