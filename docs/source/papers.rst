We demonstrate an adaptive sampling approach for computing the probability of a rare event for a set of three-dimensional airplane geometries under various flight conditions. We develop a fully automated method to generate parameterized airplanes geometries and create volumetric mesh for viscous CFD solution. With the automatic geometry and meshing, we perform the adaptive sampling procedure to compute the probability of the rare event. We show that the computational cost of our adaptive sampling approach is hundreds of times lower than a brute-force Monte Carlo method.
