Introduction
XV 15 case study.
	The XV15 tiltotor airplane  is a commonly used test bed for propeller validation work.
As you can see from this paper we have done extensive validation work on that geometry. We will now use it to show you how to analyse a propeller-type geometry using a sliding mesh interface.
Basic description of setup
	In order to run a rotating geometry we need to set up a mesh with two blocks, an inner “rotational volume” and an outer “stationary volume”. The interface between those two volumes needs to be a cylindrical geometry.
