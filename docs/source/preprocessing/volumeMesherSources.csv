Option@ Type@ Default@ Example@ Description
type@ [\"box\", \"cylinder|\]@ \"box\"@ \"box\"@ Type of source. Supported source shapes: box and cylinder. Cylinder’s axis is along the z-direction.
size@ 3-array@ REQUIRED@ [4, 3, 2]@ For type: box. Refinement zone size in x, y and z directions.
radius@ float@ REQUIRED@ 4@ For type: cylinder. Radius of the cylinder.
lengthZ@ float@ REQUIRED@ 5@ For type: cylinder. Length of the cylinder. Cylinder’s axis is along the z-direction.
center@ 3-array@ REQUIRED@ [2, 0, 0]@ Position of geometrical center of the primitive, i.e., box or cylinder.
spacing@ float@ REQUIRED@ 0.05@ Cell spacing applied in the refinement zone.
axisOfRotation@ 3-array@ @ [0, 0, 1]@ Axis of rotation for rotation transform of the primitive (box or cylinder). Requires angleOfRotation.
angleOfRotation@ float@ @ 45@ The angle of rotation (in degrees) for rotation transform of the primitive (box or cylinder). Requires axisOfRotation.
